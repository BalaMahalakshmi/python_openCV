## 📌 What is OpenCV?  
**OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)** is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.  
It provides a wide range of tools for **real-time computer vision, image processing, and numerical algorithms**.  

- Originally developed by **Intel** in 2000.  
- Written in **C/C++**, with bindings for **Python, Java, and other languages**.  
- Widely used in **AI, robotics, AR/VR, medical imaging, surveillance, and face recognition systems**.

## 🚀 Features of OpenCV  
- ✅ Image processing (blurring, thresholding, edge detection, transformations)  
- ✅ Object detection & tracking  
- ✅ Face detection & recognition  
- ✅ Machine learning & deep learning integration  
- ✅ Video analysis (motion tracking, background subtraction)  
- ✅ 2D/3D feature extraction  
- ✅ Compatible with **NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn**
